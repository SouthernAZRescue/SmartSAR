BLAZOR HERO

This SmartSAR project borrows inspiration and source code sections from BlazorHero/CleanArchitecture by iammukeshm (aka CodeWithMukesh).
It is a great project as-is for both a starting framework and as a clean example of a Modern Architecture application in Blazor WebAssembly. 
I have taken his ideas (and some source code) and adapted them to use in this DDD- and CQRS-influenced project.
